## Enabling PostHog Analytics

To enable PostHog analytics in this project, youâ€™ll need to configure your environment variables. Follow these steps:

1. **Get Your PostHog Project API Key**

    - Log in to your PostHog account (or your self-hosted instance).

    - Go to Project Settings > API Keys.

    - Copy your Project API Key (sometimes called "Project Key" or "Public Key").

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

    - Create or update your .env.local file in the root of your project with the following variables:

    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_abc123def456gh789ijklmno
    NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.posthog.com
    ```

3. **Restart Your Development Server**

    - After updating the .env.local file, restart your Next.js development server to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

4. **Verify Analytics**

    - Open your app and interact with it.

    - Go to your PostHog dashboard and check the "Activity" section to see if events are being received.
